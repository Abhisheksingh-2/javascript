// if statement: when condition is true then if statement work and enter the inside the if statement and run the statements.
// else statement : It is always used with if statement and if statement is wrong then run else statement.

let val=10;
if(val<=10){  // if and else statement work in scope method.
    console.log("TRUE Statement");
}
else{
    console.log("FALSE Statement");
}
// var: It is used to store the variable value and it is not a block scope .
// let and const  is used block scope is more efficient compare to var keyword to store the variable value.
